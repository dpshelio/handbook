Adhering to The Carpentries Style Guide
---------------------------------------

In contributing to The Carpentries website, handbook and other
resources, remember to refer to `The Carpentries Style
Guide <https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/style-guide.html>`__
and format your contributions accordingly.

For example, headings should use title casing, and tools like the `Title
Case Converter <https://titlecaseconverter.com/>`__ serve as a
definitive guide to formatting for Title Casing, complete with reasons
for or against capitalising certain words.

Another meaningful example is spellings. Because The Carpentries is a
global community-led organisation, content standardisation is important.
Our Style Guide currently recommends the use of British English in all
our resources across the board. More about this in the language section
of our Style Guide.

**How can you help?**

As you read through the resources we make available on the `Data
Carpentry <https://twitter.com/datacarpentry>`__, `Library
Carpentry <https://librarycarpentry.org/>`__, `Software
Carpentry <https://software-carpentry.org/>`__ and `The
Carpentries <https://carpentries.org/>`__ websites as well as this
Handbook and other resources, you can go to the appropriate repository
and either: - open an issue and report instances of these anomalies (low
time requirement), or

-  submit a Pull Request with edits that help standardise spellings,
   headings, etc (Moderate time requirement ).

We are also keen on continued resource provenance, so please report any
broken links as and when you come by them. `Internet Archiveâ€™s Way Back
Machine <https://archive.org/web/>`__ is a powerful tool to help you
view resources in broken links, and potentially find alternative/updated
links to the same resources.
