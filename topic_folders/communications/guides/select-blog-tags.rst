## Selecting Tags for your Carpentries Blog

We recently decided to [clean up the tags we use on The Carpentries blog](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentries.org/pull/484) so as to help everyone in our community to find posts they are interested in more easily. Below is a set of categories to help you determine which tags to include in your posts for The Carpentries blog. Remember, less is more with tags - one would be optimal, but a maximum of three would suffice, should there be a need for it. 

If in doubt over what tags to attach to your post, email community[at]carpentries[dot]org and we will help you pick one.

### By Region

In case the post you intend to publish reports on activities carried out by The Carpentries in a specific region, or holds an invitation target at a geographical subset of our community, please add a region tag, such as [Africa](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-africa), [Latin America](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-latin-america), [Australasia](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-australasia).

### By Carpentry

Since the Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry merger, and the inclusion of Library Carpentry as a lesson program of The Carpentries, we have realised the need to share relevant posts from each of the three sources with The Carpentries community. As such, cross-posted posts on The Carpentries blog will be tagged [Library Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-library-carpentry), [Data Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-data-carpentry) or [Software Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-software-carpentry) to indicate their original source.

### By Thematic Focus 

Our core team at The Carpentries works on projects that have specific themes attached to them i.e. [Assessment](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-assessment), [Equity](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-equity) and [Inclusion](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-inclusion). Additionally, as a community-led organisation, we often incorporate pertinent discussions  into our ongoing work and communicate regularly about those i.e. [Accessibility](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-assessment) and [Roadmaps](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-roadmap) for achieving specific goals.

### By Community Activity
 
The Carpentries has many different activities aimed at bringing our community members together for learning, sharing, discussions, collaboration online and in-person. Remember to tag posts by the appropriate community activity i.e. [Workshops](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-workshops), [Events](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-events) (Conferences not organised by the Carpentries, Hackathons, Meetups, Research Bazaars, Hacky Hours, etc), [Community Discussions](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-discussion-sessions), [Feedback](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-feedback), [Translations](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-translations) etc
