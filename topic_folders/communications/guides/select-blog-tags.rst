Selecting Tags for your Carpentries Blog
----------------------------------------

We recently decided to `clean up the tags we use on The Carpentries
blog <https://github.com/carpentries/carpentries.org/pull/484>`__ so as
to help everyone in our community to find posts they are interested in
more easily. Below is a set of categories to help you determine which
tags to include in your posts for The Carpentries blog. Remember, less
is more with tags - one would be optimal, but a maximum of three would
suffice, should there be a need for it.

If in doubt over what tags to attach to your post, email
community[at]carpentries[dot]org and we will help you pick one.

By Region
~~~~~~~~~

In case the post you intend to publish reports on activities carried out
by The Carpentries in a specific region, or holds an invitation target
at a geographical subset of our community, please add a region tag, such
as `Africa <https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-africa>`__,
`Latin
America <https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-latin-america>`__,
`Australasia <https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-australasia>`__.

By Carpentry
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry merger, and the
inclusion of Library Carpentry as a lesson program of The Carpentries,
we have realised the need to share relevant posts from each of the three
sources with The Carpentries community. As such, cross-posted posts on
The Carpentries blog will be tagged `Library
Carpentry <https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-library-carpentry>`__,
`Data
Carpentry <https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-data-carpentry>`__
or `Software
Carpentry <https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-software-carpentry>`__
to indicate their original source.
