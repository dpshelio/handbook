Contributing to Carpentries Lessons
-----------------------------------

Lesson Maintainers actively maintain all Carpentries lessons. However,
contributions are always welcome by all community members. Novice
contributors can read `this
guide <https://github.com/dmgt/swc_github_flow/blob/master/for_novice_contributors.md#>`__
developed by Carpentries Instructors. It provides instructions for
contributing to The Carpentries’ lesson materials using graphical or
command line interfaces with Git and GitHub.
