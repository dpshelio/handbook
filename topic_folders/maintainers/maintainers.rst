Maintainer Guidelines
---------------------

The Carpentries Maintainers work with the community to make sure that
lessons stay up-to-date, accurate, functional and cohesive. They monitor
their lesson repository, make sure that PRs and Issues are addressed in
a timely manner, and participate in the lesson development cycle
including lesson releases. They endeavour to be welcoming and supportive
of contributions from all members of the community.

Maintainers are responsible for: - Routinely: - Ensuring reasonable
response time to all submitted Issues and PRs. At a minimum, ensuring
all Issues and PRs are acknowledged within two days. - Quickly
addressing issues and PRs tagged as “bug”s. - Submitting Issues as they
arise. - Adhering to the Code of Conduct and alerting the Policy
Subcommittee to any potential violations. - Identifying potential new
Maintainers based on their review activity.

-  Every six months:

   -  Participating in regular Issue Bonanza and Bug BBQ events,
      including organising and tagging issues.
   -  Bringing in updates to the lesson template.

Maintainers represent The Carpentries community and should strive to
embody The Carpentries philosophy, by: - Recognising the importance of
communication and being welcoming to all contributors. - Giving feedback
to contributors using The Carpentries model: - Find what’s good. Be
specific about improvements needed. Use motivational language. -
Evaluating lesson contributions in light of Carpentries pedagogical
model: - Teach what’s most relevant and useful for learners. - Avoid
getting bogged down in technical details. - Keep language motivating. -
Emphasise the importance of continued learning and improvement.

Note: These guidelines are adapted from those currently in use by the
Data Carpentry Genomics Maintainers and are provisional. The Maintainer
team will be deciding on official guidelines for the full set of
Carpentries lesson Maintainers.

How to Stay in Touch
--------------------

The overall Maintainer community communicates using our `mailing
list <http://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/maintainers>`__ and our
`Slack
channel <https://swcarpentry.slack.com/messages/C8H5LN44V/details/>`__.
If you don’t already have a Slack account with The Carpentries, you can
`create one <https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/>`__.

The Maintainer community meets monthly to discuss issues relevant to all
lesson Maintainers. Our meeting schedule can be found on `our
Etherpad <http://pad.software-carpentry.org/maintainers>`__ and on the
`community
calendar <https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events>`__.

Each Lesson Team also has their own Slack channel. A link to join your
lesson’s Slack channel can be found in the README file in your lesson
repository.

How to Handle Issues
--------------------

Information coming soon.

How to Get Help
---------------

There are many ways to request help on an issue or PR you are reviewing.
To get help from other Maintainers or the general community, use the
``help wanted`` or ``good first issue`` labels.

If an issue affects the overall structure or scope of the lesson, you
can refer the issue to your curriculum’s `Curriculum Advisory
Subcommittee <../lesson_development/lesson_development_roles.html#curriculum-advisory-committee>`__
by using the ``status:refer-to-cac`` label. Remember that the Curriculum
Advisors only meet once every six months (in advance of lesson releases)
and they will likely not be able to provide a quick response to your
question.

You can also get help from other Maintainers and interested community
members by posting a question to your lesson’s Slack channel.

How to Suggest Changes to the Styling for all Lessons

Maintainer Onboarding
---------------------

New Maintainers go through an onboarding process. The curriculum for
onboarding new Maintainers is available as a `Maintainer Onboarding
Lesson <https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/>`__. This
documentation describes how to recruit new Maintainers and take them
through the onboarding process.

1)  The application to become a Maintainer is `a Google
    form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuSUffza_DrqqMwdokdNtSgNfdxzMSmbwLw8655GU31BXPyg/viewform?usp=sf_link>`__.

2)  Advertise for new Maintainers on the blog, mailing lists and
    Twitter.

3)  Once the application period has closed, reviewing applications and
    send accepted applicants an
    `invitation <email_templates.html#inviting-new-maintainers>`__ to
    become a Maintainer.

4)  To set up a scheduling poll to schedule Maintainer Onboarding, use
    `WhenIsGood <http://whenisgood.net/>`__. Click “Use Timezones” and
    then “SHOW OPTIONS”. Unselect Sunday and Saturday. Add Duration = 60
    minutes. Select “hide dates”.

5)  Add Maintainers who are going through training to the
    `maintainer-onboarding Google
    Group <https://groups.google.com/a/carpentries.org/forum/#!forum/maintainer-onboarding>`__.
    This is where announcements about upcoming meetings should be sent.

6)  After the deadline has passed for responding to the Maintainer
    Onboarding scheduling poll, select the two times that maximise
    attendance. This needs to be done manually from the whenisgood
    results, as there isn’t a “choose two times” option.

7)  Populate the `Maintainer onboarding
    Etherpad <http://pad.software-carpentry.org/maintainer-onboarding>`__
    with meeting dates and times. Use `timeanddate meeting time
    announcer <https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedform.html>`__
    links to make it easy for people to convert meeting times to their
    own time zone.

8)  Send out an
    `email <email_templates.html#maintainer-onboarding-meetings>`__ to
    the Google Group letting everyone know about the scheduling.

9)  Set up a `new event in
    AMY <../workshop_administration/amy_manual.html#adding-a-new-event>`__
    with the slug YEAR-MO-DA-maintainer-onboarding. Add all maintainer
    trainees as learners. Add onboarding leader as instructor.

10) One week before the first onboarding meeting, send a reminder
    `email <email_templates.html#onboarding-reminder>`__ to the Google
    Group.

11) Run the three weeks of meetings according to `the
    curriculum <https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/>`__.
    Keep record of who participates in the AMY event.

12) If people are not able to make all of the meetings,
    `email <email_templates.html#missed-onboarding-meeting>`__ them to
    ask them to write out responses to the discussion questions and
    homework.

13) After the final onboarding meeting, do the following for each of the
    Maintainers who have completed the onboarding requirements:

    -  Add them to the appropriate team for `Software
       Carpentry <https://github.com/orgs/swcarpentry/teams/lesson-maintainers>`__,
       `Data
       Carpentry <https://github.com/orgs/datacarpentry/teams/lesson-maintainers>`__,
       `Library
       Carpentry <https://github.com/orgs/librarycarpentry/teams/lesson-maintainers>`__,
       or `The
       Carpentries <https://github.com/orgs/carpentries/teams/lesson-maintainers>`__
       Lesson Maintainers. This will give them write privileges for that
       lesson’s repo.
    -  `Award them a Maintainer badge in
       AMY <../workshop_administration/amy_manual.html#issuing-badges>`__.
    -  If the individual has `consented to having their profile
       published <../workshop_administration/amy_manual.html#adding-an-individual-person-record>`__,
       they will appear on `The Carpentries Maintainers
       page <https://carpentries.org/maintainers/>`__ within a day.

14) Send `email <email_templates.html#welcoming-new-maintainers>`__ to
    the Maintainers email list announcing new Maintainers.

15) Run sendmail_maintainer_certificates.R to send new Maintainers their
    certificates.

16) Announce new Maintainers in the next newsletter.
