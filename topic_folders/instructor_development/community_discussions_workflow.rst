## Community Discussions Workflow

This workflow was established for the [Instructor Development Committee Discussion Session Coordinator](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/instructor_development_committee.html#discussion-session-coordinator) to organise The Carpentries [Community Discussions](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/community_discussions.html). 

### Scheduling Community Discussions

- Review responses from the [Call for Community Discussions Facilitators](https://forms.gle/nDgJWUdpaH4gYP9c9) form.
  - The [Call for Community Discussions Facilitators](https://forms.gle/nDgJWUdpaH4gYP9c9) form includes an integration which, when a form response is received, an e-mail is sent to The Carpentries Discussion Session Coordinator who should then open the attachment and review its contents.
- Add potential Community Discussions to [the Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions).
- If the Community Discussions Facilitator proposed a day/time for the community discussion they'll be hosting, add that day/time to [the Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions) as TBD in this format:
